<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 
<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, a simulated Active Directory environment was created using Oracle Virtual Box. The goal was to deepen my understanding of Active Directory and Windows networking by configuring and running this lab. The hands-on experience provided a comprehensive understanding of the workings of Active Directory and the various components involved in a real-world scenario.
